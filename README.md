# Processing
A collection of code experiments in Processing


###Face Detection
Uses the Video library to open computer camera and the OpenCV library to detect a face and track it on screen.

###Smile Detection
Uses the Video library to open computer camera and the Smile library to detect a smile and rank it on screen by the number of donuts dancing across the screen. Was used as a demonstration for a Women in Technology talk at Northern Michigan University.


###Monogram
Simple script to automate letterforms into patterns. Used to generate a large quantity of designs that were etched via laser printer onto acrylic and used as personal gifts.

###Typography
Experimenting with typography libraries such as Geomerative to add motion into type

###Emotion Detection
Large component of my senior thesis. http://lizklarecki.com/countenance/ this script would load the array of faces detected from the live exhibition and then turn on the camera and begin detecting faces using the OpenCV library. When a face was detected, it analyzed it with the Rekognition API and saved the data to the Array and a locally hosted database before using the data to add an object to the visualization projected on the wall.
